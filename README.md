```bash
npm install
yarn install
pnpm install

pnpm build
```

### Atomic Design Structure

- **Atoms**: Small, reusable components like buttons, inputs, etc.
- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms, like form inputs with labels.
- **Organisms**: Complex components built from molecules and atoms.
- **Templates**: Page templates that structure the layout.
- **Pages**: Full pages that are rendered in the app.
